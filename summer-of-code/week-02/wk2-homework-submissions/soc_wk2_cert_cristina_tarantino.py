# it may take a long time to complete and you might not have time to wait for it ;)

# I have uncommented the lines below to avoid program crashing
# recursions are good looking but have a great time and space complexity
# and they can cause stack overflows which then causes the applications to crash
# recursion are implemented using memory stack. A stack has a size,
# once the recursion uses more space than the stack has available we incur in stack overflow
